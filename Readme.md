### Why we abandon RasPad OS and launch RasPad Launcher

RasPad OS intergrated with RasPad Launcher, RasPad FAQ with our custom UI and boot animations, which is redundant. And people loves the idea of RasPad Launcher, so we decided to remove all unnecessary components, and keep RasPad Launcher as a single app. So people can install it your own Raspberry Pi OS.
